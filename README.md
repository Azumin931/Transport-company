Good job but here are some suggestions:

1. You need to update this README file with a description of your project and the technologies you used. And you need to provide instructions on how to run your project locally.
2. Also, you need to add a license file to your project.
3. Now you need to serve your website using a web server, you can use ReactJS for that.
